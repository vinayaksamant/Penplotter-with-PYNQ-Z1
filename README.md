This project focuses on the design, development,
testing and implementation of an embedded system whose
primary objective is to convert captured images by a camera
into line drawings and later plot onto a paper using pen plotter,
where all these actions can be controlled using a touchscreen
display with a simple and friendly graphical user interface. The
system features a camera module for clicking pictures,
processing the images into line drawings, and producing
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format making it suitable for
the pen plotter machine. The whole system is coordinated using
the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) module available
on the PYNQ-Z1 board to process the images, feeding inputs to
the pen plotter and receiving the commands from user interface
touch/button inputs.
