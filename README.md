Designed, developed, tested, and implemented an embedded system that converts images captured by a camera into line drawings and plots them onto paper using a pen plotter. The system includes a touchscreen-based graphical user interface for intuitive control, a camera module for image capture, and functionality to process images into line drawings and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for compatibility with the pen plotter. The entire system is coordinated using the FPGA module on the PYNQ-Z1 board, which handles image processing, feeds commands to the pen plotter, and interfaces with user inputs through touch or button controls.
